        <body class="bluepaint">Argh. At nighttime I become obsessed with you sometimes. I wish you knew who you were. I wish I could eat you. I wish I could destroy you... hehe. My unfiltered thoughts will go here, when I can't sleep and I have my computer at hand. I want to ruin you. I want you to ruin me. I need to become stronger for my own good. What happened to when I was happy? Why am I so behind on life? I'm exhausted, but I still love you, I think. Asshole. <br>
        -Asshole<br>
        <br>
        P.S.: I hate everyone and all who are nosy. I hate those who feel the need to poke into my life for their own enjoyment. Why can't I be left alone? Why do I take the little privacy I do have to my advantage? Dead or alive, I am bound to lose. It seems. Urgh.<br>
