    5/12/22<br>
        It's been a while since I've done anything, really. Most days are spent playing video games and sleep sleep sleeping... I dropped my computer science class today and I'm continuing to 'procrastinate' 我的中文功课。At least I have the Chinese Keyboard enabled, at last. 我很喜欢学中文和我想学多。我最近看看中国卡通， 非常奇怪的啊。https://youtu.be/5wXg6dgQ2Ac Here's a link so that I may hopefully find it again in the future. Anywho. Does anyone actually read this? If so... at least give me a hint that you do, would ya?<br>

        I've become unmotivated to keep updating this. Yaaawn! Life's been the same though. I made a cool octo today at least. Ta-da!<br>
        <br>M, as usual!<br>

        Today I am sleepy. Sleepy, sleepy sleepy. I didn't sleep well last night, and hopefully I can sleep better tonight... I have school in the morning, and I really should go this time..... sigh... I had a nice enough day though otherwise. Went on about a 7 mile walk today and then had cheesy cake factory with mimi. It was my first time returning since I walked out on them about a year ago... Being a dishwasher there was one of the most physically grueling, if not THE most physically grueling things I've ever had to do. Anywho. I was hoping I wouldn't have to see anyone I knew... unfortunately, the bartender, a very outgoing and nice man who looks pretty young for his age (especially with a mask on) was one of the only people there who had actually left an impression on me, and yet I didn't even say a word about who I was to him, despite his recognition of me. I was so exhausted and disheveled I could barely talk, it was awful! Even if I hadn't been, being in the building after so long was stressing me out as well. At least mimi was a bit more cordial with him than me. Anywho, after we were seated at our actual seat I had a chinese chicken salad and mimi had some enchilada things, and they were good (although the chinese chicken salad seems surprisingly sugary with all the sauce on it). Anyway, tired tired, so I'm going to stop blabbering now. Bye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>
        <br>M, as usual!<br>

        Adrian always help me cheer up a bit, especially in person. We stopped by C&B today and visited Bryce which was a bit fun, and then we went to Joanne's and back to my house. We modeled Pikachus and I 3D printed his silly ant. I had to modify the legs to be thick enough to print cause they were so teensy tiny! Afterwards we went to our reservation at Din Tai Fung where the food was a bit bland on my end. I had a short ribs appetizer that costed 11 bucks and a strange tofu soup with glass noodles. Adrian had ji rou jiaozi which I thought tasted just as good as the trader joes ones... (which isn't to say they tasted bad at all, good but just about the same). We stopped by starbucks after and got a vanilla frap and a hot chocolate. Now I'm home and just about done for the day!<br>
<br> Mine truly, M  <br>

    Today (Or I suppose my waking hours yesteday) have not been as nice, necessarily. Yesterday I went on a walk for an hour an a half which was a little bit nice, although not much to say about it. I saw all the tar spots on the sidewalk which inspired me to add them to the little scene I'm making in blender. Speaking of, Every scene I make seems to hit a point of immense lag, even with my PC. Part of the problem, it turns out, was me putting a subdivision surface node up to five in a set of geometry nodes, which was extremely painful to find out. Anywho, I had Chinese class last night and I played video games the whole time. Tomorrow I have a test which is nice cause I won't have to trudge through the whole class on edge about being called on while in the middle of something stupid. Gosh, I'm so lost in my life right now. I simply don't know what I'm supposed to do! I was supposed to go to computer science this morning (CS-30), but I slept in instead cause it's just too damn early. This was supposed to be the semester that I embraced my computer science degree and turned it around for the better. Instead, I'm struggling even more after missing out on a foundational basis with the previous classes. Whatever. Not really sure what to do for my career anymore. I still like art but this whole semester's experience has put me into an extreme depression. I need to talk to a doctor (Dr.) or some counselor (No abbreviation available). Maybe even a therapist! Anyway. Buh. I'll be hanging out with that little fella Adrian soon enough so I suppose I should be going now. Toodle-oo!<br>
    <br>Spitefully loving, M   <br>  
        

        
        
        
              LOGBOOK: DAY 1<br>
    4/18/22<br>
    Today was my first day as a 20 year old. WHOOPEE! (Well, yesterday if you want to be technical about it). I had the idea of logging my adventures from this point onward, but we'll see what happens from here. My day was alright. It was easter, and it was also my birthday, which was a bit funny. I got a good amount of cash (Although I'm personally not a big fan of the stuff, seeing the greed it can create), but I'm thankful nonetheless. There was a tres leches cake, a chocolatey fudge-like cake, a cheesecake, a banana pie, cookies, and a lot more sugar. Mimi did a great job with the chicken and beef skewers, even if they weren't actually on skewers. They even had yummy peanut sauce to go with them which I'd say was my favorite part. Also, I didn't actually try the beef. Anywho, I slept in late and I was a bit hesitant to leave my room until she did her ususal go about of knocking two seconds before entering. My dad gave me a hug and I'm afraid that could be one of the only hugs we get from each other this year considering how little we actually partake in the action, for better or for worse. I'm tired now and I don't feel like typing much more, although I'd like to say Adrian created a lovely little ant for me tonight out of many vertices and colors and I think it's absolutely exceptional. I'll even post a picture of it right here!
    <br>Love, M      <br>
